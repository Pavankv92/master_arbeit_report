\section{Data acquisition}

\subsection{Robot guided trajectory} As shown in the \cref{fig:robotic_data_acquisition}  setup consists of 2 cameras (RGB-D and a tracking camera), a robot, phantom head with EEG cap. Position of both cameras from robot base is determined using two hand-eye calibrations respectively. The robot is precisely guided around the phantom head on a circular trajectory while continuously capturing RGB and depth images at 30fps. The process is repeated several times with different circular trajectory each time and recorded as ROS .bag files for later processing.

TODO : add details about the number of camera poses in the trajectory.

\subsection{Hand guided trajectory} As shown in the \cref{fig:hand_data_acquisition}  setup consists of tracking camera and a  RGB-D camera as in the robot guided setup. However, a reflective marker is attached to RGB camera in order to be tracked from tracking camera in the absence of a robot.  RGB camera is hand guided around the phantom head trying to maintain a circular trajectory while continuously capturing RGB and depth images at 30fps. The process is repeated several times with different trajectory each time and recorded as ROS .bag files for later processing.

\subsection{Hand-eye calibration for hand guided trajectory}
A reflective marker is firmly attached to the camera as shown in the \cref{fig:blue_kinect_marker}. In the absence of a robot,  \cref{eq:hand-eye} is still holds with  $\tfMat{tCam}{T}{marker}$ as M,  $\tfMat{marker}{T}{kCam}$ as X,  $\tfMat{tCam}{T}{CB}$ as Y and  $\tfMat{CB}{T}{kCam}$ as N as shown in \cref{fig:handeye_calibration_hand_data}


TODO : add trajectroy details, camera filed of view issue. add an image of cut trajectory, hand eye results.
