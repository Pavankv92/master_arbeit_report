\chapter{Abstract}
Electroencephalography (EEG) is used to record electrical activities of the brain using an electrode cap which is placed on the scalp. A crucial step of EEG is the accurate estimation of the electrode position on the scalp. In the current research project, the positions of the electrodes should be obtained with the help of a RGBD camera, which is hand-guided around the head in a specific trajectory. For this purpose, the camera needs to be localized with respect to the head and, simultaneously, the model of the electrodes on the cap should be mapped. The 3D Electrode positions in one camera frame are given by a previous step of the project pipeline. The camera can be localized by sequentially registering the point clouds acquired along a camera trajectory using iterative closest point algorithms (ICP). The ICP estimation can be used to build a pose graph and in turn, solve the optimization problem that corrects the trajectory estimated by ICP and builds an electrode map. The main objective of this thesis is to accurately estimate the 3D locations of the electrodes using Kinect (RGBD) sensor by applying ICP and pose graph optimization techniques and to evaluate the performance.
