\section{Software architecture}

\subsection{ROS} Robot operating system \cite{ROS} is an open-source software which serves as middleware for robotic software development across many platforms. ROS offers a flexible framework of numerous libraries, software tools for communication, motion planning, navigation, localization and mapping and for robust robotic software development. ROS supports many programming languages including C++, Python, Matlab, etc. A modular and distributed software platform along with a vibrant user community all over the world makes ROS very popular among roboticists, students and researchers. In this project, communication between camera and robot are implemeted by exploiting ROS features like publishers and subscibers and visualization tool Rviz has been employed effectively.
