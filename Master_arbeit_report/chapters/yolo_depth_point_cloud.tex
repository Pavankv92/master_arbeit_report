\section{Point cloud for scan registration} As previously discussed, point cloud for scan registration is generated by combining 2D pixel values from YOLO detection and depth value from Kinect. The middle point of the YOLO bounding box is taken as pixel value and corresponding depth value is retrieved to form a 3D point cloud. Only a few electrodes are visible at each camera position and the same electrode can be seen from multiple adjacent images. Therefore slight variations on the bounding box position, thereby on the middle point of the bounding boxes is expected. There are also cases where electrodes are not detected in any of the camera frames by YOLO and few false positives as shown in \cref{fig:electrodes_seen_but_not_detected}.
