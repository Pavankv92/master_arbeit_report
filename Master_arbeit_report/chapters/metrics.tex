\section{Performance metrics}  This section provides an overview of metrics used to evaluate the performance of algorithms. Firstly, we compute the absolute 3D position error between estimated and ground truth electrodes. As we saw earlier that there are series of errors involved in gathering ground truth data and transferring it to Kinect for frame error computation. Therefore, we also perform an ICP registration between estimated and ground truth electrodes. Quite an insight can be obtained by comparing the estimated and ground truth trajectory (see appendix : pose comparison ). As previously mentioned, all the camera poses are expressed with respect to the first camera pose (which is also the global reference frame) before we compare the trajectory as shown in \cref{fig:metric_absolute_pose}. Lastly, we compute the difference between ICP estimated transformation for subsequent camera poses and ground truth poses. As shown in \cref{fig:metric_icp_pose}, we skip one pose in order to have sufficient distance between 2 camera pose ($>$4mm @ 30fps).

Summary of all metrics.
\begin{enumerate}
	\item Absolute 3D Position error 
		\begin{enumerate}
			\item $L2 Norm_i $ = $ \sqrt{ {(x_{gi}-x_{ei})^2} + {(y_{gi}-y_{ei})^2} + { (z_{gi}-z_{ei})^2} } $
			\item L2 Norm list =$[L2 Norm_i, ............................, L2 Norm_N]^T$
			\item where $gi$ and $ei$ are ground truth and estimated electrodes respectively. N is total number of electrodes in the cap.
			\item Mean +/- STD Deviation of L2 Norm list are reported.
		\end{enumerate}
	\item Relative 3D position error 
		\begin{enumerate}
			\item Post registration RMSE = ICP (Estimated electrode cloud, ground truth electrode cloud)
		\end{enumerate}
	\item Trajectory comparison 
		\begin{enumerate}
			\item Rotation angle (axis-angle representation) Mean +/- STD Deviation

		\end{enumerate}
	\item ICP vs ground truth comparison 
		\begin{enumerate}
			\item Rotation angle (axis-angle representation) Mean +/- STD Deviation
